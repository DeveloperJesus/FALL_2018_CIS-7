The video on divisbility was the most helpful for me. I get lost at times in all the technicalities that come along with formulating mathematical proofs. This video in particular hammers home how to approach these kinds of problems with several example problems. It also introduces/talks about the division algorithm which is helpful for understanding the Euclidian algorithm later on.
